Gruze is a persistent object store written in Haskell.

This is currently alpha quality code tested only with MySQL (although it may
work with other databases as it uses ODBC).

An example model (blogging with multiple user roles) can be found in gruzeTest.

To try this out:

a. cd to gruzeStore and type

cabal install

b. create a database and run the schema in gruzeStore/schema/schema.sql to add
the required tables

c. copy the data directory somewhere and make it writable by Haskell

d. cd to gruzeTest and edit the config values near the top of Main.hs
to match your own configuration

e. type

cabal install

in gruzeTest

f. find the gruzeTest executable in gruzeTest/dist/build/gruzeTest and run
it from a shell

g. read gruzeTest/Main.hs for more information

Eventually there will be a test suite and full documentation.
