Gruze is a persistent object store written in Haskell.

This is currently beta quality code tested with Sqlite3, MySQL (both native and
ODBC drivers) and PostgreSQL

An example model (blogging with multiple user roles) can be found in gruzeTest.

To try this out:

a. cd to gruzeStore and type

cabal install

b. create a database and run the appropriate schema in gruzeStore/schema to add
the required tables

c. copy the data directory somewhere and make it writable by Haskell

d. cd to gruzeTest and edit the config values near the top of Main.hs
to match your own configuration. There are four sample config settings.

You will need to choose one and edit the getHandle function below to pass the
appropriate config settings.

You will also need to select and compile the appropriate database driver
from the four supplied.

e. type

cabal install

in gruzeTest

f. find the gruzeTest executable in gruzeTest/dist/build/gruzeTest and run
it from a shell

g. read gruzeTest/Main.hs for more information

Eventually there will be a test suite and full documentation.
